# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: April 06, Monday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i have decided that i will take the challange.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with maintaining continuity in my programming, but now I feel that this challenge will help me to keep a flow in my programming and help me to get better in it. 


### Day 1: April 07, Tuesday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i solved hackerrank's Binary Numbers's problem.

**Thoughts:** I was not willing to code today, but I made myself sit and do it. It was a part of 30 days challenge, which I left earlier in b/w, but from today I am restarting it. Initially, I do not found it interesting while solving, but when the solution was accepted,  I felt awesome.

**Scope of Improvement:** Practise delayed gratification & keep doing what you are doing.

### Day 2: April 08, Wednesday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i tried hackerrank's 2D Arrays problem.

**Thoughts:** As I started today, the problem seemed to okay, but I misinterpreted the question; I thought the problem is out of my league, and then I read the editorial of hacker rank, which I do not found that much helping because they directly shared the code. I am still in confusion on how to figure it out on my own. . 

**Scope of Improvement:** Make the solution on the paper than try to code.

### Day 3: April 09, Thrusday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i solved & tried couple of problems from codechef & hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** As I started early today and solved two CodeChef DSA Learning Series problems & spent most of my time-solving the third one, I again didn't read the question correctly, so I got the incorrect solution I will solve the issue soon. However, I also tried hackerrank's 12th problem. 

**Scope of Improvement:** read the question twice & properly.

### Day 4: April 10, Friday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved CodeChef problem but trying to solve hacker earth's problem.

**Thoughts:** Today most of the went writing the assignments of my college so I started late so the problem is unsolved it will solve it tomorrow. 

**Scope of Improvement:** Be Punctual and complete your work before deadlines.
