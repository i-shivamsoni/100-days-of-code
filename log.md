# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: April 06, Monday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i have decided that i will take the challange.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with maintaining continuity in my programming, but now I feel that this challenge will help me to keep a flow in my programming and help me to get better in it. 


### Day 1: April 07, Tuesday 2020. 

**Today's Progress**: Today i solved hackerrank's Binary Numbers's problem.

**Thoughts:** I was not willing to code today, but I made myself sit and do it. It was a part of 30 days challenge, which I left earlier in b/w, but from today I am restarting it. Initially, I do not found it interesting while solving, but when the solution was accepted,  I felt awesome.
